# Ney Editor

## About the editor

This is a simple text editor project made with Python just for fun !

Still a very early WIP, for now this editor can :
- Create, open and edit .txt files
- Create, open and edit .ney files
- Put text in **bold**, *italic* and <ins>underlined</ins>
- Changing color of text

Saving a file as .txt will remove all of the text format for obvious reasons

## About .ney files

Well, these are basically json files that the editor is able to parse and render as text with special formatting. Nothing more than that really
